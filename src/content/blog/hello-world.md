Welcome to my corner of the internet.

After some deliberation, I've decided to rebuild my personal site from scratch. The result is what you see before you: a blend of vintage aesthetics and modern technology, a site that feels both nostalgic and forward-looking.

## Why a new site?

Sometimes you need a fresh start. The previous iteration served me well, but it was time for something that better reflected who I am today. I wanted something minimal yet distinctive, professional yet personal.

## The tech stack

This site is built with:

- **Astro** — A modern static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- **TypeScript** — Because type safety matters

The design draws inspiration from retro-futurism: the optimistic vision of the future as imagined in the past. Think warm cream tones, deep navy, and copper accents. Subtle scan lines and geometric patterns add texture without overwhelming the content.

## What's next?

I plan to write about:

- Software development and engineering practices
- Technology and its intersection with design
- Thoughts and reflections on the craft

Stay tuned. There's more to come.
