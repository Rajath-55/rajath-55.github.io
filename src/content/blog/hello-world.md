I was not really an AI person at all in my previous company (Cisco). We never really had a bar set, or expectations to be met when we shipped features / fixed bugs. In quite a few companies, the expectation now is to have x% of your code be AI-generated, which is a weird as fuck metric but I guess it pleases the overlords, and so it has become mainstream. But what mainly is interesting to me is not how much code AI generates, but how exactly we can _review_ the code it generates efficiently.

Now that I've started using Augment at work and Claude code for personal use-cases, I've truly begun to realise how powerful these tools are to aid you, if not to fully replace a few parts of your daily life as a software engineer. Engineering is not merely prompting, but prompting and tooling for AI are now quite literally some of the most essential pieces of an ever-growing puzzle in the world of LLM generated content, and this holds true in particular for coding mainly because of how exhaustively these models have been trained on (almost) all of the world's open-source code at least.
