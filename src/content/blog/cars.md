I've been a car enthusiast ever since I was probably 5 years old. Every car I could see on the road, I was able to name with the model and the engine to perfection. Although that skill has long vanished now, the little kid in me still likes to think that I have a (small) passion for cars that has not died yet. 

My driving patterns have now fundamentally shifted. I drive mostly in the city, hours and hours of slow moving traffic. It is still not as bad as nearly fully stop and go traffic most of the times, but thats a possibility in the near future seeing the way Bengaluru is growing. Hence the question that naturally arises is - is there a point at which a manual makes no sense anymore considering the driving patterns?
